        playing an instrument is great for one’s health. For example, violinist Vov Dylan writes “Rese
        arch shows it’s an excellent way to relieve stress, which means they can experience lower levels of de
  pression and anxiety.” (Dylan).  Not only does music allow the artist to express themselves, but the very feeling of
        playing this instrument has allowed many to deal with stress and find comfort during tough times by providing an emotional outlet.

         reading skills, language processing, speech, and a variety of brain functions.” (Revelle Team).  This shows that it is scientifically proven how crucial 
         playing an instrument can be. One’s brain can learn things faster and all these improvements can help one do better at school.</tt> </p>

    <p><tt>It sounds a bit weird, as in how does playing an instrument improve one’s social life? Well, “...young children gain self-discipline from repeated practice.   Playing an instrument can build self-reliance, self-esteem, and self-awareness - qualities which make them well-liked and well-adjusted.” (Revelle Team). This means that many important qualities can be learned through music and players can become independent, strong, and smart. Violin can help boost self-esteem as well because, after every run-through of a piece, skills start to improve and the artist becomes prouder of themselves. Violin boosts not just self-esteem, but one’s overall confidence. According to an article written by professional violinist Thomas McGregor, “When you perform, or simply play in front of an instructor, you build confidence. Every time you receive positive feedback from an external source, your confidence builds and that, in turn, positively impacts your playing.” (McGregor). Playing in front of an audience may seem scary at first, but when you play quite often you feel comfortable and happy. 
        Hence proving that the violin is an incredible instrument capable of helping you in many areas of life.</tt></p>
